# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-Python

This guide provides an overview of common exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python. We will cover data type conversion, handling duplicates, deleting and renaming columns, and imputing missing values. Below are step-by-step instructions and code snippets for each task.

## 1. Data Type Conversion

Data type conversion is essential for ensuring that each column in your DataFrame has the appropriate data type for analysis. how to convert data types in Python using pandas: give it in file.

## 2. Handling Duplicate Values

Remove duplicate rows
df = df.drop_duplicates()

Alternatively, keep the first or last occurrence
df = df.drop_duplicates(keep='first')
df = df.drop_duplicates(keep='last')

## 3. Deleting and Renaming Columns
Deleting unnecessary columns and renaming columns for clarity can be done.

## 4. Missing Value Imputation
Handling missing values is crucial for data quality. The strategy depends on the percentage of missing values and the presence of outliers.

4.1 Imputation Strategy
0% to 5% Missing Values: Drop records/rows with missing values.
6% to 45% Missing Values: Replace missing values with appropriate statistics (mean, median, mode).
More than 50% Missing Values: Drop the column.

If outliers are present in that column, replace missing values with median
if no outliers in column replace missing value with mean
if categorical column replace missing value with mode.

## Conclusion
This guide provides foundational techniques for exploratory data analysis in Python. Tailor these methods to fit the specific needs of your dataset and analysis goals.

Feel free to adapt the code snippets as needed for your particular use case.
